## Introduction

The Migration Steering Committee has conducted the process of creating a [new brand](https://forum.nem.io/c/catapult-branding) for Catapult. The new brand "Symbol from NEM" has been [supported by the community](https://explorer.nemtool.com/#/poll?id=5e2eaab5328dc579fdadcef3) together with the ticker [XYM](https://explorer.nemtool.com/#/poll?id=5e2eaab5328dc579fdadcef3).

The objective of this NIP is to coordinate efforts to rename all repositories under the ``nemtech`` organization on GitHub.

## Specification

### Packages

The names of the repositories, URLs, and installable packages names will be edited as follows:

| Previous   | New        |
|------------|------------|
| nem2-      | symbol-    |
| catapult-* | symbol-    |
| Catapult   | Symbol     |

All ``nem2-*`` related packages will be removed from ``npmjs`` and ``maven`` to prevent users installing and old version of the package by mistake.

### GitHub Organization

The organization will remain as  ``nemtech``. In the future, high-quality NIS projects can be supported.

### GitHub Pages

The ``nemtech`` organization will preserve the repository ``nemtech.github.io`` to redirect GitHub pages related links (e.g. symbol-docs, SDK references, symbol-openapi) to the new domain ``https://docs.symbolplatform.com``.

### Ticker

Hardcoded references to ``nem.xem`` have to be replaced for ``symbol.xym``. For references to private networks using the default network currency, ``cat.currency`` will still be used.

### Continuous Integration

Some external services might need to be reconfigured manually per repository, including:

* TravisCI
* Coveralls

Each sig organizer should give priority to add again the services required to merge new PRs into master (e.g., testing pipelines) before adding new features to each project.

### Redesign

If necessary, adapt colors, fonts, and logo accordingly to the latest [brand update](https://forum.nem.io/t/symbol-brand-update/24305).

It is recommended that each repository creates a separate branch to start applying the redesign without interfering with other incoming features.

## Design Decisions

The specification proposed tries to minimize 404 errors when accessing to old links.
Github will [automatically redirect](https://github.blog/2013-05-16-repository-redirects-are-here/) the previous links to the new URLS.

## Implementation

For each project, a new issue named "Rebranding" will be created with the following tasks list:

    * [ ] Rebranding branch created
    * [ ] New design applied (font, logos, colors)
    * [ ] Codename references renamed
    * [ ] Ticker references renamed
    * [ ] Links reviewed
    * [ ] README reviewed
    * [ ] PR created
    * [ ] Package renamed
    * [ ] Package deployed/tag created

### Milestone 1

Target repositories:

* [x] nem2-sdk-typescript-javascript
* [x] nem2-openapi
* [x] nemstudios/nem2-open-api-generator (migrated GitHub & npm nemtech org)
* [x] nemstudios/catbuffer-generator (migrated to npm nemtech org)
* [x] nem2-sdk-java

### Milestone 2

Target repositories:

* [x] nem2-docs
* [x] nem2-cli
* [x] nemfoundation/symbol-desktop-wallet
* [x] nemfoundation/nem2-explorer

### Milestone 3

Target repositories:

* [ ] nem2-e2e-tests
* [ ] nem2-scenarios
* [x] nemfoundation/nem2-uri-scheme
* [x] nemfoundation/nem2-hd-wallets
* [x] nemfoundation/nem2-qrlibrary

### Milestone 4 (under discussion)

Target repositories:

* [ ] catapult-server
* [ ] catapult-rest
* [ ] catapult-service-bootstrap
* [ ] catapult-whitepaper
* [ ] catbuffer

``*`` At this moment, there are no plans to rename ``catapult-server`` nor ``catapult-rest`` repositories.

### Milestone 5

* [x] new domain added
* [x] CI services migrated 

## Backwards Compatibility

By approving this proposal, it is assumed that:

- It might not be possible to migrate every link.
- It might penalize the project's SEO.

Nevertheless, it is preferable in the long term to have consistent branding. Applying those changes sooner than later will cause fewer redirections in the future.
