## Introduction

This document aims to provide with a decision making process about upgrading the current public blockchain network NEM (hereafter "**NIS1**") with the newly available Catapult Technology (hereafter "**Catapult**", each of which represent a "_Project_" and both "_Projects_").

Following projects are target of this documentation:

- [`NIS1`: NemProject/nem.core](https://github.com/NemProject/nem.core)
- [`Catapult`: nemtech/catapult-server](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-server)

Discussions have been made about migration of NIS1 data sets to Catapult but several points remain open for discussion and unresolved.

## Specification

This section describes the process that will be followed when Catapult releases to a Public Network.

### Issue Resolution Guidelines

Many **issue resolutions** must be found (decisions to be taken) with the definition of this migration process. As to provide a clear way of determining whether an issue (decision) has been resolved, we will define base information about issue resolution with guidelines laid out in this section.

**Issue resolution** are to be _numbered_ from 1 to n (where n is the count of issue resolutions) and will be referred to with the `IR` prefix. Following examples match our **issue resolution identifier** format:

- IR-1
- IR-2
- IR-10

Next to the creation of a so-called _issue resolution identifier_ we will be adding the _issue resolution description_ in a table under section [Issue Resolutions](#issue-resolutions).

Additionally, every _issue resolution_ will be marked with _one of the following_ annexed information:

- In case of an **unresolved issue** (replace `IR-1` with _issue resolution identifier_ and set summarizing title):

```
:warning: (**IR-1** _Summarizing Title_) **An issue resolution must be made here.**
```

- In case of a **resolved issue** (replace `IR-1` with _issue resolution identifier_, set title and add description of decision taken):

```
:white_check_mark: **Issue Resolution IR-1: _Summarizing Title_**

> Descriptive text about the decision that has been taken
```

### Post-Upgrade Situation

Multiple scenarios can conceptually be planned or a blockchain network upgrade. With the caracteristics of distributed ledger technology and **its' blockchain**, it is of utter importance to **determine a planned post-upgrade scenario**. 

This conceptual plan and process definition will provide us with optimal settings as to communicate our network upgrade to the public, to partners and exchanges. Introduced technical debt will be handled by special interest groups under section [Introduction of Technical Debt](#introduction-of-technical-debt).

:warning: (**IR-1** _Post-Upgrade Situation_) **An issue resolution must be made here.**

#### One Chain Approach

Historical data about distributed ledger network _forks_ has shown that it is possible to upgrade a blockchain network by **hard fork** gathering the majority of community / supporters / participants consensus.

In the scenario of a **one chain approach** fork, datasets from the previous network will need to be migrated to the newly setup Catapult network. **This adds up to the development of _many migration tools_** to permit the migration of several datasets currently available on the NEM blockchain network.

This scenario would **officially deprecate** the previous NIS1 network. Yet, it is **possible** that the NIS1 network would be kept online by businesses, community or supporters who would not upgrade their nodes. In the event that the NIS1 chain lives on after the **hard fork**, account holders will effectively own double balances because two networks will have split independently.

Mitigating the risks of a **split** is possible by providing with _tools for the migration_ but **a network split in a _one chain approach_ is caracterized by a bigger introduced technical debt.**

With regards to **Partners-** and **Exchanges-** _integrations_, the _one chain approach_ would **introduce technical debt on the side of partners** for them to be up to date with the newly created chain. Each exchange that lists trading pairs for `XEM`, would need to update their nodes and software handling deposits/withdrawals.

Additionally, partners and client integrations **must upgrade** their software in order for their software to function ahead of the migration.

#### Two Chains Approach

Another option that has arrised from historical data research about distributed ledger network _forks_ is to upgrade a blockchain network by **creating a _network apart from the previous network_**. This scenario **intentionally produces two separate chains as an outcome**.

In the scenario of a **two chains approach** fork, datasets from the previous network will also need to be migrated to the newly setup Catapult network but datasets can be **ellected** with more flexibility as to create a _fresh start of the new chain_.

It is **possible** that the NIS1 network would be kept online by businesses, community or supporters. Additionally, with the _two chain approach_, at the moment of genesis of the new chain, **only the balances of the old chain have actual capital value**.

There is fewer risks associated with this scenario as Partners and Exchanges must decide whether they want to support the newly setup Catapult network or not. **The creation of the new network will not affect available integrations.**

With regards to the migration of datasets for this scenario, it can be done with more flexibility. As such, **we must ellect datasets to be migrated on to the newly created network.** A section [Dataset Migrations](#dataset-migrations) will be provided in this document to _define datasets that will be migrated_.

#### Fork Schemes

In the event of the public release, the post-upgrade situation can be managed with two different fork schemes.

- **Fork with Snapshot**: The new chain is identical up to _fork block_ and then splits. Account holders are **automatically** credited on new chain.
- **Fork with Burn**: Account holders must burn tokens on _old chain_ to get credited on _new chain_.

Following [research and discussions][slack-public-migration] on Slack discussion threads and in multiple [research documents][gdocs-migration-options-analysis], there is legal implications with the _burn fork scheme_ with regards to stakeholders balances. In fact, in the event of an opt-in base balance migration (burn / claim), the managing committee could be held responsible for possible loss of funds. This is undesired and most likely to be avoided.

Another important note about fork schemes that was described during research is that currently there is no migration process defined for many datasets available on NIS1. This includes the migration of multi-signature account setups as their cryptographical verifiability would be lost in the event of a migration. We are actively working on solutions to migrate multi-signature accounts.

**Research is still ongoing as to improve the migration process and to make it as seamless as possible for the end-user. The decision made in following issue resolution (IR-2) _MAY change_.**

:white_check_mark: **Issue Resolution IR-2: _Snapshot or Burn_**

> Due to possible legal implications of the burn (opt-in) fork scheme, it is preferred to migrate datasets with the **Snapshot fork scheme**.

#### Ellected Situation

Possible outcomes include, and are limited to:

- **Catapult** technology **upgrades** NIS1, resulting in **one chain** and network.
- **Catapult** technology is **released alongside** of NIS1, resulting in **two chains** and networks **with Snapshot scheme**.
- **Catapult** technology is **released alongside** of NIS1, resulting in **two chains** and networks **with Burn scheme**.

The ellected post-upgrade network situation will be determined by the resolution of **IR-1: _Post-Upgrade Situation_**.

### Migrated Modules / Datasets / Integrations

Following list includes all the migrated modules that are currently available with NIS1 and datasets or _integrations_ (exchanges/clients) that must be taken into account when **migrating** to the Catapult technology:

- [Account data (balance(s), importance, multisig relationships)](#account-data)
- [Transaction history](#transaction-history)
- [Namespaces](#namespaces)
- [Mosaics](#mosaics)
- [Second Layer Integrations](#second-layer-integrations)
- [Exchanges Integrations](#exchanges-integrations)

Each of these migrated modules and datasets will be described more in detail in sub-sections of this document under the section [Dataset Migrations](#dataset-migrations).

### Process Implications

Several points have to be taken into account about implications of the migration in both **legal** and **technical** domains. Each of these implications that are open for resolution will be described in a sub-section of the current section.

#### Legal implications

The proposed approaches for migration imply the creation of a potential taxable event. It is important to clear this point before migration can be planned correctly.

- Can/Should we avoid the creation of a taxable event ? **NO**
- Is the creation of a taxable event a **blocking** Point for migration ? **NO**

:white_check_mark: **Issue Resolution IR-3: _Taxable event creation_**

> The creation of a taxable event is non-blocking to the migration because it will effectively affect users only upon *trading tokens* which falls off of our responsibility scope.

#### Technical implications

During the process of migration, it is preferred that end-users **know exactly what they have to do** in order for the Catapult migration/release to be successful. For this, we should be defining important documentation and article references in this section, that will give end-users an overview of how the necessary steps for the upgrade can/should be taken.

Additionally, we will be providing an overview of the technical debt that accompanies the _Catapult release on Public Network_ grouped in the different Special Interest Groups as described in [nemtech/community](https://github.com/nemtech/community).

Following list may be re-defined over time, when decisions have been made on subsequent topics. Below is the list of **important tools and documentation for the Catapult Release on Public Network**.

- `catapult-service-bootstrap`: [Guide: Docker containers for Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-service-bootstrap)
- `catapult-server`: [Building Instructions for Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-server/blob/master/BUILDING.md)
- `catapult-rest`: [Guide: Run your own REST gateway for Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-rest)
- `nem2-sdk-*`: [Guide: NEM2 TS/JS for Public Network Integrations](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-sdk-typescript-javascript)
- `nem2-cli`: [Guide: NEM2 CLI for Public Network Integrations](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-cli)
- `nem2-docs`: [Section: Catapult Public Network Integration](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-docs)
- `nem2-e2e-tests`: [Testing: Usage with Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-e2e-tests)
- `all-projects`: [Testing Clients/SDK/Docs: Usage with Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech)

Some of the listed **tools and documentation** may change due to decisions taken on subsequent topics. Also, some of the tools will require work assignment to permit usage with Public Network Nodes.

:white_check_mark: **Issue Resolution IR-4: _Migration tools development_**

> Integrations / Implementations to be finished by end of Q3 2019.

#### Reputational implications

Due to the decentralized aspect of the NIS1 and Catapult technologies, each and every _supporting_ end-user is bound to upgrade the NIS1/Catapult technology as told by this publication.

This can have implications in the reputational form as well. In fact, the overall _NEM branding_ may be affected by the public chain release. It is of utter importance that the migration process is well defined and **understood** by end-users in order to ensure a public chain release with smaller negative reputational harm.

:white_check_mark: **Issue Resolution IR-5: _Reputational harm analysis_**

> The public chain release of Catapult will affect the reputation of NEM.

> Branding, PR and news coverage will be managed during the next months (Q3, Q4 2019) as to increase momentum for the Catapult technology release.

#### Partner implications

Second Layer Integrations of the NIS1 network as well as any other client integrations **will be affected** by the network upgrade. As such, it is important to measure the implications for our partners to be able to make decisions on whether the upgrade must be done by their side or if help is to be requested for the matter.

This analysis will make sure that our partners can estimate the time needed for their teams to make upgrades as a way for us to **optimally** prepare our network migration.

:white_check_mark: **Issue Resolution IR-6: _Catapult upgrade technical definition_**

> A guide has been written to be used for upgrading features using NIS1 to features using Catapult.
> The NIS1 migration guide can be found on the NEM Developer Center: https://nemtech.github.io/guides/migration/migrating-from-nis1-to-catapult.html#migrating-from-nis1-to-catapult

### Dataset Migrations

This section describes the different datasets that have to be taken into account when migrating to Catapult technology. Each of the datasets available will be analysed in terms of _how it can be migrated over to Catapult_.

:warning: (**IR-7** _Define mandatory migrated datasets_) **An issue resolution must be made here.**

#### Account Data

This dataset contains account balances (XEM only), importance delegations and multi-signature information. Migrating this data over to Catapult is currently being discussed.

:warning: **Account data is sensitive data as it directly affects balances of end-users. It is important to provide with a clear migration process for this dataset.**

1. [ ] **Importance Delegation History**
2. [ ] **Multi-Signature Historical Data**
3. [ ] **Multi-Signature Information**
4. [ ] **XEM Balances**
5. [ ] **Importances Historical Data**

#### Transaction History

This dataset contains the complete transactions history of the NIS1 blockchain network. In the event of a **one chain migration**, this dataset does not need to be addressed further.

:warning: **The history of transactions of the NIS1 blockchain network permits to keep track since the nemesis of NEM. This is an important note to take into account while defining the migration process for transactions. Regardless of the fork scheme and post-upgrade scenario, losing transactions history may have a drastical effect on legal implications.**

1. [ ] **Transfer Transaction**
2. [ ] **Modify Multisig Transaction**
3. [ ] **Importance Transfer Transaction**
4. [ ] **Register Namespace Transaction**
5. [ ] **Mosaic Definition Transaction**

#### Namespaces

This dataset contains ownership information about namespaces on NIS1. Namespaces on NIS1 may be linked directly to **mosaics**. Additionally, namespaces on NIS1 can be used as an alias to the namespace owner address.

With Catapult, namespaces are not linked directly to mosaics or addresses anymore. A process of _aliasing_ has been introduced which, in fact, is not backwards-compatible.

1. [ ] **Root Namespaces**
2. [ ] **Sub Namespaces**

#### Mosaics

This dataset contains account balances (custom mosaics) and distribution history for custom mosaics. Partners MUST be contacted in order to understand their usage of the NIS1 blockchain network. This will help improve the migration process for custom mosaics.

:warning: **Partners will be affected by the defined migration process.**

1. [ ] **Balances**
2. [ ] **Distribution (Transfers)**

#### Exchanges Integrations

The exchanges integrations of the _NIS1_ network represent those datasets that are related to **exchanges integrations of XEM or custom Mosaics on the NEM blockchain Public Network**.

:warning: **Each exchange integration for XEM mosaics must be contacted for a clear resolution on whether _migration_ will be supported by work on their side or not**.

List of available XEM Buy / Sell Integrations:

- [Annex 1: Exchange integrations list](https://github.com/evias/NIP/blob/nip-public-network/NIPs/nip-0008/exchanges-list.md)

:warning: **Businesses who have issued custom mosaics on the NEM blockchain Public Network must be contacted in order to find a clear resolution on their future with the Catapult technology**.

List of available Custom Mosaics Buy / Sell Integrations:

- [Annex 2: Exchange list for Custom Mosaics](https://github.com/evias/NIP/blob/nip-public-network/NIPs/nip-0008/exchanges-custom-mosaics.md)

#### Second Layer Integrations

Second layer integrations of the NIS1 blockchain network are numerous. Some of those have found a general usage adoption within the NIS blockchain network and MAY require some planning to improve the Catapult public chain release.

This section will provide with a non-exhaustive list of NIS1 integrations as to analyze multiple feature scopes that have found usage adoption within the NIS1 blockchain network.

1. [ ] **Apostille**

Feature Scope: TransferTransaction with hexadecimal messages, BIP32/public key derivation

2. [ ] **Voting**

Feature Scope: TransferTransaction with JSON plain messages, public key derivation

3. [ ] **Signed Messages**

Feature Scope: public key encryption

4. [ ] **Domain Name Services (DNS)**

Feature Scope: Namespaces, Addresses, TransferTransaction

8. [ ] **Unlisted partners**

Partners that are not listed in this section can be found in following curated integration list: https://github.com/Sateetje/awesome-nem-projects

### Introduction of Technical Debt

During the process of decision making on the _Catapult release on Public Network_, it is possible that technical debt is introduced through any of the decisions/resolutions taken. In order to favoritize a smooth release, it is best that the introduced technical debt is planned/organized/described in this document accordingly.

As such, special interest groups will be listed with their **introduced technical debt** in the following table:

| SIG | Technical Debt Topic | Assigned ? |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Backwards compatibility

As the Catapult software is a rewrite in a different software development language, it is not possible to provide with a simple update process. Backwards compatibility is being reviewed and researched and should be discussed in this document.

All backwards incompatible modules and features of the Catapult technology are being evaluated in order find clear resolutions on the topics _before migration can happen_.

:warning: **More information will be described in this section when issues have been resolved.**
