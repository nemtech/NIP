## Introduction

This document aims to provide with a decision making process about upgrading the current public blockchain network NEM (hereafter "**NIS1**") with the newly available Catapult Technology (hereafter "**Catapult**", each of which represent a "_Project_" and both "_Projects_").

Following projects are target of this documentation:

- [`NIS1`: NemProject/nem.core](https://github.com/NemProject/nem.core)
- [`Catapult`: nemtech/catapult-server](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-server)

Discussions have been made about migration of NIS1 data sets to Catapult but several points remain open for discussion and unresolved.

## Specification

This section describes the process that will be followed when Catapult releases to a Public Network. 

### Possible Outcomes

Possible outcomes include, and are limited to:

- **Catapult** technology **upgrades** NIS1, resulting in **one chain** and network.
- **Catapult** technology is **released alongside** of NIS1, resulting in **two chains** and network.

Hereafter, these two outcomes will be referred to as the `one chain approach` and the `two chains approach` respectively.

**Issue Resolution**: **One Chain Approach** OR **Two Chain Approach**

### Migrated Modules / Datasets / Integrations

Following list includes all the migrated modules that are currently available with NIS1 and datasets or _integrations_ (exchanges/clients) that must be taken into account when **migrating** to the Catapult technology:

- [Account data (balance(s), importance, multisig relationships)](#dataset-migration-account-data)
- [Transaction history](#dataset-migration-transaction-history)
- [Namespaces](#dataset-migration-namespaces)
- [Mosaics](#dataset-migration-mosaics)
- [Second Layer Integrations](#dataset-migration-second-layer-integrations)
- [Exchanges Integrations](#dataset-migration-exchanges-integrations)

Each of these migrated modules and datasets will be described more in detail in sub-sections of this document under the section [Dataset Migrations](#dataset-migrations).

### Process Implications

Several points have to be taken into account about implications of the migration in both **legal** and **technical** domains. Each of these implications that are open for resolution will be described in a sub-section of the current section.

### Legal implications

The proposed approaches for migration imply the creation of a potential taxable event. It is important to clear this point before migration can be planned correctly.

- Do we want our end-users to be affected with a taxable event ? **YES** / **NO**
- Can/Should we avoid the creation of a taxable event ? **YES** / **NO**
- Is the creation of a taxable event a **blocking** Point for migration ? **YES** / **NO**

Other reference documentation available here: [Tax Considerations for ICOs](https://nem2.slack.com/files/U9G1B8BAT/FJKB78FJA/tax-considerations-for-icos.pdf)

**Issue Resolution**: **Resolution to be described here.**

### Technical implications

During the process of migration, it is preferred that end-users **know exactly what they have to do** in order for the Catapult migration/release to be successful. For this, we should be defining important documentation and article references in this section, that will give end-users an overview of how the necessary steps for the upgrade can/should be taken.

Additionally, we will be providing an overview of the technical debt that accompanies the _Catapult release on Public Network_ grouped in the different Special Interest Groups as described in [nemtech/community](https://github.com/nemtech/community).

Following list may be re-defined over time, when decisions have been made on subsequent topics. Below is the list of **important tools and documentation for the Catapult Release on Public Network**.

- `catapult-service-bootstrap`: [Guide: Docker containers for Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-service-bootstrap)
- `catapult-server`: [Building Instructions for Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-server/blob/master/BUILDING.md)
- `catapult-rest`: [Guide: Run your own REST gateway for Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-rest)
- `nem2-sdk-*`: [Guide: NEM2 TS/JS for Public Network Integrations](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-sdk-typescript-javascript)
- `nem2-cli`: [Guide: NEM2 CLI for Public Network Integrations](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-cli)
- `nem2-docs`: [Section: Catapult Public Network Integration](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-docs)
- `nem2-e2e-tests`: [Testing: Usage with Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-e2e-tests)
- `all-projects`: [Testing Clients/SDK/Docs: Usage with Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech)

Some of the listed **tools and documentation** may change due to decisions taken on subsequent topics. Also, some of the tools will require work assignment to permit usage with Public Network Nodes.

**Issue Resolution**: **Integrations / Implementations to be finished by end of Q2 2019.**

### Dataset Migrations

3. will there be any legal implication to the migration of this dataset ? **YES** / **NO**
5. will there be any technical debt introduction with the migration of this dataset ? **YES** / **NO**

:warning: **Businesses who have issued custom mosaics on the NEM blockchain Public Network must be contacted in order to find a clear resolution on their future with the Catapult technology**.

### Introduction of Technical Debt

During the process of decision making on the _Catapult release on Public Network_, it is possible that technical debt is introduced through any of the decisions/resolutions taken. In order to favoritize a smooth release, it is best that the introduced technical debt is planned/organized/described in this document accordingly.

As such, special interest groups will be listed with their **introduced technical debt** in the following table:

| SIG | Technical Debt Topic | Assigned ? | Blocking Topic ? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #sig-api | SDK TS/JS Keccak Implementation | :white_check_mark: | **NO** |
| #sig-api | SDK Java Keccak Implementation | :stop_sign: | **NO** |
| #sig-api | Docker instructions for Public Network Nodes | :stop_sign: | **NO** |
| #sig-client | Migration tools | :stop_sign: | **YES, needed resolution on [Possible Outcomes](#possible-outcomes)** |
| #sig-docs | Guide for Public Network | :white_check_mark: | **YES, needed resolution on [Possible Outcomes](#possible-outcomes)** |
| #sig-testing | End-to-end test suite | :white_check_mark: | **NO** |
| catapult-server | Build instructions for Public Network Nodes | :stop_sign: | **NO** |

## Backwards compatibility

As the Catapult software is a rewrite in a different software development language, it is not possible to provide with a simple update process. Backwards compatibility is being reviewed and researched and should be discussed in this document.

All backwards incompatible modules and features of the Catapult technology are being evaluated in order find clear resolutions on the topics _before migration can happen_.

:warning: **More information will be described in this section when issues have been resolved.**
