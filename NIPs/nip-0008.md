## Introduction

This document aims to provide with a decision making process about upgrading the current public blockchain network NEM (hereafter "**NIS1**") with the newly available Catapult Technology (hereafter "**Catapult**", each of which represent a "_Project_" and both "_Projects_").

Following projects are target of this documentation:

- [`NIS1`: NemProject/nem.core](https://github.com/NemProject/nem.core)
- [`Catapult`: nemtech/catapult-server](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-server)

Discussions have been made about migration of NIS1 data sets to Catapult but several points remain open for discussion and unresolved.

## Specification

This section describes the process that will be followed when Catapult releases to a Public Network.

### Issue Resolution Guidelines

Many **issue resolutions** must be found (decisions to be taken) with the definition of this migration process. As to provide a clear way of determining whether an issue (decision) has been resolved, we will define base information about issue resolution with guidelines laid out in this section.

**Issue resolution** are to be _numbered_ from 1 to n (where n is the count of issue resolutions) and will be referred to with the `IR` prefix. Following examples match our **issue resolution identifier** format:

- IR-1
- IR-2
- IR-10

Next to the creation of a so-called _issue resolution identifier_ we will be adding the _issue resolution description_ in a table under section [Issue Resolutions](#issue-resolutions).

Additionally, every _issue resolution_ will be marked with _one of the following_ annexed information:

- In case of an **unresolved issue** (replace `IR-1` with _issue resolution identifier_ and set summarizing title):

```
:warning: (**IR-1** _Summarizing Title_) **An issue resolution must be made here.**
```

- In case of a **resolved issue** (replace `IR-1` with _issue resolution identifier_, set title and add description of decision taken):

```
:white_check_mark: **Issue Resolution IR-1: _Summarizing Title_**

> Descriptive text about the decision that has been taken
```

### Post-Upgrade Situation

Multiple scenarios can conceptually be planned or a blockchain network upgrade. With the caracteristics of distributed ledger technology and **its' blockchain**, it is of utter importance to **determine a planned post-upgrade scenario**. 

This conceptual plan and process definition will provide us with optimal settings as to communicate our network upgrade to the public, to partners and exchanges. Introduced technical debt will be handled by special interest groups under section [Introduction of Technical Debt](#introduction-of-technical-debt).

:warning: (**IR-1** _Post-Upgrade Situation_) **An issue resolution must be made here.**

#### One Chain Approach

Historical data about distributed ledger network _forks_ has shown that it is possible to upgrade a blockchain network by **hard fork** gathering the majority of community / supporters / participants consensus.

In the scenario of a **one chain approach** fork, datasets from the previous network will need to be migrated to the newly setup Catapult network. **This adds up to the development of _many migration tools_** to permit the migration of several datasets currently available on the NEM blockchain network.

This scenario would **officially deprecate** the previous NIS1 network. Yet, it is **possible** that the NIS1 network would be kept online by businesses, community or supporters who would not upgrade their nodes. In the event that the NIS1 chain lives on after the **hard fork**, account holders will effectively own double balances because two networks will have split independently.

Mitigating the risks of a **split** is possible by providing with _tools for the migration_ but **a network split in a _one chain approach_ is caracterized by a bigger introduced technical debt.**

With regards to **Partners-** and **Exchanges-** _integrations_, the _one chain approach_ would **introduce technical debt on the side of partners** for them to be up to date with the newly created chain. Each exchange that lists trading pairs for `XEM`, would need to update their nodes and software handling deposits/withdrawals.

Additionally, partners and client integrations **must upgrade** their software in order for their software to function ahead of the migration.

#### Two Chains Approach

Another option that has arrised from historical data research about distributed ledger network _forks_ is to upgrade a blockchain network by **creating a _network apart from the previous network_**. This scenario **intentionally produces two separate chains as an outcome**.

In the scenario of a **two chains approach** fork, datasets from the previous network will also need to be migrated to the newly setup Catapult network but datasets can be **ellected** with more flexibility as to create a _fresh start of the new chain_.

It is **possible** that the NIS1 network would be kept online by businesses, community or supporters. Additionally, with the _two chain approach_, at the moment of genesis of the new chain, **only the balances of the old chain have actual capital value**.

There is fewer risks associated with this scenario as Partners and Exchanges must decide whether they want to support the newly setup Catapult network or not. **The creation of the new network will not affect available integrations.**

With regards to the migration of datasets for this scenario, it can be done with more flexibility. As such, **we must ellect datasets to be migrated on to the newly created network.** A section [Dataset Migrations](#dataset-migrations) will be provided in this document to _define datasets that will be migrated_.

**Fork Schemes**

In the event of a migration happening with the **two chains approach**, there is also two possible **fork schemes** identified:

- **Fork with Snapshot**: The new chain is identical up to _fork block_ and then splits. Account holders are **automatically** credited on new chain.
- **Fork with Burn**: Account holders must burn tokens on _old chain_ to get credited on _new chain_.

More details about these two alternatives will be provided here.

:warning: (**IR-2** _Snapshot or Burn_) **An issue resolution must be made here.**

#### Ellected Situation

Possible outcomes include, and are limited to:

- **Catapult** technology **upgrades** NIS1, resulting in **one chain** and network.
- **Catapult** technology is **released alongside** of NIS1, resulting in **two chains** and networks **with Snapshot scheme**.
- **Catapult** technology is **released alongside** of NIS1, resulting in **two chains** and networks **with Burn scheme**.

The ellected post-upgrade network situation will be determined by the resolution of **IR-1: _Post-Upgrade Situation_**.

### Migrated Modules / Datasets / Integrations

Following list includes all the migrated modules that are currently available with NIS1 and datasets or _integrations_ (exchanges/clients) that must be taken into account when **migrating** to the Catapult technology:

- [Account data (balance(s), importance, multisig relationships)](#dataset-migration-account-data)
- [Transaction history](#dataset-migration-transaction-history)
- [Namespaces](#dataset-migration-namespaces)
- [Mosaics](#dataset-migration-mosaics)
- [Second Layer Integrations](#dataset-migration-second-layer-integrations)
- [Exchanges Integrations](#dataset-migration-exchanges-integrations)

Each of these migrated modules and datasets will be described more in detail in sub-sections of this document under the section [Dataset Migrations](#dataset-migrations).

### Process Implications

Several points have to be taken into account about implications of the migration in both **legal** and **technical** domains. Each of these implications that are open for resolution will be described in a sub-section of the current section.

#### Legal implications

The proposed approaches for migration imply the creation of a potential taxable event. It is important to clear this point before migration can be planned correctly.

- Can/Should we avoid the creation of a taxable event ? **NO**
- Is the creation of a taxable event a **blocking** Point for migration ? **NO**

:white_check_mark: **Issue Resolution IR-3: _Taxable event creation_**

> The creation of a taxable event is non-blocking to the migration because it will effectively affect users only upon *trading tokens* which falls off of our responsibility scope.

#### Technical implications

During the process of migration, it is preferred that end-users **know exactly what they have to do** in order for the Catapult migration/release to be successful. For this, we should be defining important documentation and article references in this section, that will give end-users an overview of how the necessary steps for the upgrade can/should be taken.

Additionally, we will be providing an overview of the technical debt that accompanies the _Catapult release on Public Network_ grouped in the different Special Interest Groups as described in [nemtech/community](https://github.com/nemtech/community).

Following list may be re-defined over time, when decisions have been made on subsequent topics. Below is the list of **important tools and documentation for the Catapult Release on Public Network**.

- `catapult-service-bootstrap`: [Guide: Docker containers for Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-service-bootstrap)
- `catapult-server`: [Building Instructions for Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-server/blob/master/BUILDING.md)
- `catapult-rest`: [Guide: Run your own REST gateway for Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-rest)
- `nem2-sdk-*`: [Guide: NEM2 TS/JS for Public Network Integrations](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-sdk-typescript-javascript)
- `nem2-cli`: [Guide: NEM2 CLI for Public Network Integrations](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-cli)
- `nem2-docs`: [Section: Catapult Public Network Integration](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-docs)
- `nem2-e2e-tests`: [Testing: Usage with Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-e2e-tests)
- `all-projects`: [Testing Clients/SDK/Docs: Usage with Public Network Nodes](https://github.com/nemtech)

Some of the listed **tools and documentation** may change due to decisions taken on subsequent topics. Also, some of the tools will require work assignment to permit usage with Public Network Nodes.

:white_check_mark: **Issue Resolution IR-4: _Migration tools development_**

> Integrations / Implementations to be finished by end of Q2 2019.

#### Reputational implications

Due to the decentralized aspect of the NIS1 and Catapult technologies, each and every _supporting_ end-user is bound to upgrade the NIS1/Catapult technology as told by this publication.

This can have implications in the reputational form as well. More details will follow in this section.

:warning: **This section is currently not described correctly.**

:warning: (**IR-5** _Reputational harm analysis_) **An issue resolution must be made here.**

#### Partner implications

Second Layer Integrations of the NIS1 network as well as any other client integrations **will be affected** by the network upgrade. As such, it is important to measure the implications for our partners to be able to make decisions on whether the upgrade must be done by their side or if help is to be requested for the matter.

This analysis will make sure that our partners can estimate the time needed for their teams to make upgrades as a way for us to **optimally** prepare our network migration.

:warning: (**IR-6** _Catapult upgrade technical definition_) **An issue resolution must be made here.**

### Dataset Migrations

This section describes the different datasets that have to be taken into account when migrating to Catapult technology. Each of the datasets available will be reviewed by asking the following questions:

1. **In the scenario of the _one chain approach_**
1.1. **will _not migrating dataset_ make majority of users unhappy and/or prefer NIS1?**
1.2. **will _not migrating dataset_ irreparably harm nem/catapult reputation?**
1.3. **will dataset be migrated ?**
2. **In the scenario of the _two chains approach_**
2.1. **will _not migrating dataset_ make majority of users unhappy and/or prefer NIS1?**
2.2. **will _not migrating dataset_ irreparably harm nem/catapult reputation?**
2.3. **will dataset be migrated ?**
3. **will there be any legal implication to the migration of this dataset ?**
5. **will there be any technical debt introduction with the migration of this dataset ?**

Each sub-section may have _siblings_ which are datasets that are related to the given sub-section dataset. Siblings are not required.

Additionally, each sub-section will be affected a **list of task assignments** that must be fulfilled in order for the sub-section to be resolved. The set of tasks will be the following (do not fill in these tasks) :

### Introduction of Technical Debt

During the process of decision making on the _Catapult release on Public Network_, it is possible that technical debt is introduced through any of the decisions/resolutions taken. In order to favoritize a smooth release, it is best that the introduced technical debt is planned/organized/described in this document accordingly.

As such, special interest groups will be listed with their **introduced technical debt** in the following table:

| SIG | Technical Debt Topic | Assigned ? | Blocking Topic ? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #sig-api | SDK TS/JS Keccak Implementation | :white_check_mark: | **NO** |
| #sig-api | SDK Java Keccak Implementation | :stop_sign: | **NO** |
| #sig-api | Docker instructions for Public Network Nodes | :stop_sign: | **NO** |
| #sig-client | Migration tools | :stop_sign: | **YES, needed resolution on [Possible Outcomes](#possible-outcomes)** |
| #sig-docs | Guide for Public Network | :white_check_mark: | **YES, needed resolution on [Possible Outcomes](#possible-outcomes)** |
| #sig-testing | End-to-end test suite | :white_check_mark: | **NO** |
| catapult-server | Build instructions for Public Network Nodes | :stop_sign: | **NO** |

## Backwards compatibility

As the Catapult software is a rewrite in a different software development language, it is not possible to provide with a simple update process. Backwards compatibility is being reviewed and researched and should be discussed in this document.

All backwards incompatible modules and features of the Catapult technology are being evaluated in order find clear resolutions on the topics _before migration can happen_.

:warning: **More information will be described in this section when issues have been resolved.**
