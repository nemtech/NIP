## Introduction

The QR Library Standard must allow generating different types of QR codes for contacts, wallet backups or transaction requests.

Following QR code types are identified:

1. Wallet Import/Export QR code.
2. Transaction Request QR code for anyone to issue a pre-configured transaction.
3. Contacts QR code for adding an address to a contacts list.

## Motivation

With this NIP, it is intended that the QR code generation processes for Catapult _client implementations_ use a _standard_ way of dealing with QR codes representing several different objects on a Catapult network.

The new version of the Catapult network adds a bit of complexity on top with several types of transactions. Those will all be covered in _Transaction Requests_. 

As to allow better cross-network compatibility, we will also inspect the best ways of adding a **replay protection** to QR codes such that they will be linked to one _type_ of network and one _network guid_ (if available - nemesis hash if not).

As to provide with cross-client compatible and Catapult-network compatible QR codes, we need to define a standard for definition of QR codes.

## Purpose

Following section defines specific **purposes** of integration and/or generation of QR codes by their respective types. This section will also include examples of QR codes JSON definition as to provide with an overview of available fields and features.

### Legacy NEM / NIS1 QR format

Several client implementations for NEM blockchain have come up with a non-standardized way of generating QR codes. The most used definition of QR codes can be found in the [nem-library](https://github.com/NemProject/nem-library) in following implementation of the [`QRService`](https://github.com/NemProject/nem-library-ts/blob/master/src/services/QRService.ts).

The JSON representation used in this legacy QR code standard defines a **transfer transaction request** as shows the following example:

```json
{
  "v": 2,
  "type": 4,
  "data": {
    "addr": "",
    "mosaics": [{
      "name": "nem:xem",
      "qty": 10}],
    "msg": "",
    "name": ""
   }
}
```

### Cross-client cross-network compatibility

This library standard aims to produce a cross-client _and_ cross-network compatible QR code generation reference implementation. This is to provide client implementations of the Catapult protocol with a standardized way of handling QR codes.

Legacy QR codes have been known to be only partially compatible between different client implementations. It is up to the client to implement a way of generating QR codes and setting up this library standard will permit better cross-client compatibility.

Additionally, Catapult most likely will introduce many different networks and it is important to define a common QR code standard in order to avoid networks incompatibilities.

## Specification

This section describes the **specification** of our QR code library Standard. QR codes that are to be generated with client implementations of the Catapult network _can_ use this specification as a reference to be NIP-7 compatible.

### Catapult QR code format (version 3)

For the Catapult network client implementation, we previously identified different types of QR codes. Following table lists them with their **type ID** and details about their data schema.

| **Type ID** | **data schema** | **description** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | address, name | Contact Import/Export |
| 2 | name, priv_key, salt | Accounts Import/Export |
| 3 | address, transactionData | Transaction requests |

#### Catapult QR code base schema

Our library standard must define fielda that will be present in **all QR codes** generated with our library. Those fields describe the base schema of QR codes compatible with our standards definition.

Following table lists mandatory fields for Catapult QR Codes compatible with NIP-7:

| **field** | **type** | **values** | **description** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| v | integer | `3` | The QR Code version. |
| type | integer | `1` \| `2` \| `3` | The QR Code type. |
| network_id | integer | `0x68` for Mainnet \| `0x98` for Testnet \| `0x60` for Mijin \| `0x90` for Mijin_test | The related Network type. |
| chain_id | string | _replay protection_ with 32 bytes nemesis hash of the network. |
| data | object | `{}` | The QR code specialized data (see AddContractQR, ExportAccountQR, TransactionRequestQR). |

#### Catapult AddContactQR schema

This section describes `AddContactQR` QR codes data schema with a fields description table and an example:

| **field** | **type** | **description** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| data | object | The QR code data |
| data.addr | string | The contact account address. |
| data.name | string | The contact name. |

    "name": "John Invisible",
   }
}
```

#### Catapult ExportAccountQR schema

This section describes `ExportAccountQR` QR codes data schema with a fields description table and an example:

| **field** | **type** | **description** |

| data | object | The QR code data |
| data.encryptedKey | string | 32 bytes IV prepended to 96 bytes of encrypted payload resulting int: `iv || encryptedKey`. |
| data.salt | string | 32 bytes salt that was used for encryption. |

#### Catapult TransactionRequestQR base schema

This section describes `TransactionRequestQR` QR codes data schema with a fields description table and an example:

}
```

## Implementation

An implementation proposal has been started with following specification:

- Package name `nem2-qr-library` at https://github.com/AnthonyLaw/nem2-qr-library
- interface `QrCode` with method `build()`
- class `AddContactQR` with implementation for `build()`
- class `ExportAccountQR` with implementation for `build()`
- class `TransactionRequestQR` with implementation for `build()`
- Review of the library's OOP structure has been done and is being worked on.

### Ongoing Work

- interface `QrCode` with method `build()`
- class `AddContactQR` with implementation for `build()`
- class `ExportAccountQR` with implementation for `build()`
- class `TransactionRequestQR` with implementation for `build()`
- Review of the library's OOP structure has been done and is being worked on
- QR library must bridge with `nem2-sdk` account/addresses objects
- QR library must bridge with `nem2-sdk` transaction objects

## Backwards compatibility

Legacy QR codes currently being used on the NEM Mainnet (and Testnet) will not be compatible with the propose QR codes definition standard.

Catapult introduces many new features with many newly added transaction types. Yet, the `AddContactQR` and `ExportAccountQR` **may** keep backwards compatibility in adopting the same _schema_ as used in legacy implementations.
