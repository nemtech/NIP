## Introduction

This document aims to provide with a **standard** for _issuance_ and _management_ of **security tokens** on Symbol. This standard will be structured as such that _standard interfaces_ will be defined to facilitate _operations_ and _interrogations_ related to security tokens.

## Motivation 

Facilitate and accelerate the processes of _issuance_ and _management_ of security tokens on Symbol.

To issue and manage securities on Symbol, this standard will leverage several Symbol features. Implementation details will be described in a document jointly to this standard definition.

## Specification

### Requirements

The security token standards to be described in this document will be based on features available with [Symbol][symbol] networks. Additionally, for each standard, we will define requirements that will apply to the underlying asset class.

- MUST have a standard interface to query feasibility of a transfer and return a reason for failures.
- MUST be able to perform forced transfer for legal action or fund recovery.
- MUST define standard notifications for issuance and redemption processes.
- MUST be able to attach metadata to a **subset of a token holder's balance**.
- MUST be able to modify metadata at time of transfer based on off-chain data, on-chain data and the parameters of the transfer.
- MUST support querying and subscribing to updates on any relevant documentation for the security.
- MAY require signed data to be passed into a transfer transaction in order to validate it on-chain.
- SHOULD NOT restrict the range of asset classes across jurisdictions which can be represented.

### Features Description

Following features table will be used to define mandatory features of the published software package:

| Feature | Motivation |
| --- | --- |
| Issuance | Issuance of security tokens is managed through `owner` |
| Issuer Power Delegation | `Operators` can be allowed specific management tasks of the security tokens |
| Transfer |  Security tokens can be transferred (change ownership) |
| Batch Transfer | Security tokens can be transferred in batches (change ownership) |
| Transfer with Metadata | Metadata can be added to transfers of security tokens |
| Metadata management | Metadata can be managed for security tokens |
| Transfer restrictions | Transfers of security tokens can be restricted (constraints) |
| Freeze/Lock | Security token balances can be frozen/locked by `operators` |
| Operator enforcement | `Operators` can be allowed tasks enforcements (such as transfers) |
| Force Transfer | Transfers of security tokens can be **enforced**. |
| Error signaling | Error signaling is described for each Standard |
| Document management | Documents can be attached to security tokens [ownerships] |

### Token Commands

Token Standards introduce the term of **commands** that are executed for specific tokens. For instance, the transfer of token happens by _executing the command TransferOwnership_ for said token.

This concept of _commands_ will be available for all Token Standards. As such we will define a list of commands that will also be technically defined in the implementation details.

| Token Command | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| **PublishToken** | Issue/Publish a previously created token (non-reversable) |
| **TransferOwnership** | Transfer a token to a new owner |
| **TransferOwnershipWithData** | Transfer a token to a new owner, adding signed data as a message |
| **BatchTransferOwnership** | Batch Transfer tokens to new owners |
| **ForcedTransfer** | Force the transfer of a token to a new owner, with an operator account |
| **LockBalance** | Freeze / Lock a token balance |
| **UnlockBalance** | Unfreeze / Unlock a token balance |
| **ModifyRestriction** | Send modifications to account/mosaic restrictions |
| **ModifyMetadata** | Send modifications to account/mosaic metadata |
| **DelegateIssuerPower** | Delegate issuance authorizations to operator(s) account(s) |
| **AttachDocument** | Attach documents to a token instance |

### Token Restrictions

1. **Operator accounts** must be _restricted to use only the following types of transactions_:
  * [MultisigAccountModificationTransaction](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/multisig-account.html#multisig-account-modification-transaction)
  * [MosaicDefinitionTransaction](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/mosaic.html#mosaic-definition-transaction)
  * [MosaicSupplyChangeTransaction](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/mosaic.html#mosaic-supply-change-transaction)
  * [NamespaceRegistrationTransaction](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/namespace.html#namespace-registration-transaction)
  * [MosaicAliasTransaction](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/namespace.html#mosaic-alias-transaction)
  * [MosaicGlobalRestrictionTransaction](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/mosaic-restriction.html#mosaic-global-restriction-transaction)
  * [MosaicAddressRestrictionTransaction](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/mosaic-restriction.html#mosaic-address-restriction-transaction)
  * [MosaicMetadataTransaction](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/metadata.html#mosaic-metadata-transaction)

2. Adding **token restrictions** must leverage [_Mosaic Restrictions features_](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/mosaic-restriction.html).

3. Adding **token metadata** must leverage [_Metadata features_](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/metadata.html).

### Token Metadata

NIP#13 does not introduce any _mandatory_ Metadata. Token operators are free to attach any type of metadata to security tokens.

### Token Features

NIP#13 introduces a Security Token Standard which will be implemented mostly with **mosaics**, **multi-signature** accounts and transactions. Work on this standard has not begun by the time of writing.

Following features are available with our Security Token Standard:

| Feature | [NIP-13][src-nip13] |
| --- | --- |
| Issuance | :white_check_mark: |
| Issuer Power Delegation | :white_check_mark: |
| Transfer | :white_check_mark: |
| Batch Transfer | :white_check_mark: |
| Transfer with Metadata | :white_check_mark: |
| Metadata management | :white_check_mark: |
| Transfer restrictions | :white_check_mark: |
| Freeze/Lock | :white_check_mark: |
| Force Transfer | :white_check_mark: |
| Error signaling | :white_check_mark: |
| Operator enforcement | :white_check_mark: |
| Document management | :white_check_mark: |

## Design Decisions

### 1. Namespaced Standards

Because each of the Token Standards will behave differently from others with regards to feature set integrations, we will implement commands in such a way that each standard can define its own extension to the standard command execution flow.

Commands will be grouped in **namespaces** such that each Token Standard can implement commands with its own feature set integration practises. Following examples MAY apply:

#### Use the NIP13 standard and execute PublishToken command

```typescript
// Import NIP13 namespace
import { NIP13 } from 'symbol-security-tokens';

// prepare
const tokenId = new TokenIdentifier();
const command = new NIP13.PublishToken();
const options = [Option.create('tokenId', tokenId.toString())];

// now execute command
const result = command.execute(tokenId, options);
```

## Implementation

This document defines a general purpose Token Standard. Those defined standards will leverage different feature sets of Symbol networks. More detailed implementation details will be described here.

In order to generalize and facilitate security token issuance and management with Symbol, we will publish **one software package** that integrates _all Token Standards_.

Still, each of our different standards will be implementing features differently as to be more flexible and allow a broader scope of integrations or use case implementations.

The released software package will be developed with Typescript, using the [symbol-sdk@>=0.17.3][src-sdk] package to integrate latest Symbol features. The library MUST provide with interfaces and classes, which developers can leverage to manage issuance and redemptions of security tokens on Symbol.

As a proof of concept for this library, we MAY introduce either of a command line interface (CLI) or a basic web application to provide with out-of-the-box Security Token support for Symbol.

### Features Proposal

| Command | Execution Flow |
| --- | --- |
| **PublishToken** | 1) Creates a deterministic operator account <br> 2) Convert operator account to multi-signature <br> 3) Publish creation proof transaction on deterministic account <br> 4) Create **mosaic** with operator account |
| **TransferOwnership** | 1) Change ownership of token through **multi-signature modification** using transaction as execution proof |
| **TransferOwnershipWithData** | 1) Prepare signed data (3rd-party client side) <br> 2) Change ownership of token through **multi-signature modification** using transaction as execution proof and **attach signed data** inside transfer transaction from the operator account |
| **ForcedTransfer** | 1) TBD - should use mosaic restrictions |
| **BatchTransferOwnership** | 1) Change ownership of tokens with multiple execution proof transactions |
| **DelegateIssuerPower** | 1) Modify multi-signature account to add/remove operators |
| **AttachDocument** | 1) Publish cryptographic hash of document <br> 2) Send message in transaction to deterministic account |

### Packaging Proposal

A deliverable package will be produced along with this NIP. Naming for this package is **yet to be defined**. 

Following are the available package name suggestions, more may be added at a later point:

- [ ] ~~`symbol-security-tokens`~~
- [x] `symbol-financial-instruments`
- [ ] ~~`symbol-financial-tools`~~
- [ ] ~~`symbol-derivatives`~~
- [ ] ~~`symbol-instruments`~~

The decision making process for this package name selection will be made internally, more suggestions are welcome.

### Architecture Proposal

Each of our Security Token Standards will implement features with a pre-defined feature set of Symbol. This is important to note as this knowledge will influence the architecture of the release package. Following solution proposal can be applied:

```

    - Command.ts
    > NIP13/
      - PublishToken.ts
      - TransferOwnership.ts
      - AttachDocument.ts
      - ...

    - TokenSource.ts with properties `source: string` (network generationHash)
    - TokenMetadata.ts with properties `tokenId: TokenIdentifier`, `field: string`, `value: string`
    - TokenRestriction.ts with properties `tokenId: TokenIdentifier`, `restriction: MosaicRestriction`
```

### Implementation Proposal

#### Interfaces

- A `Standard` interface is defined that MUST contain following methods:

```javascript
    /**
     * Creates a new Security Token with pre-defined Catapult feature set.
     *
     * @param   {string}          name
     * @param   {Address}         owner
     * @param   {TokenSource}     source
     * @param   {Array<Address>}  operators
     * @return  {TokenIdentifier}
     **/
    public create(
      name: string,
      owner: Address,
      source: TokenSource,
      operators: [Address] = []): TokenIdentifier;

    /**
     * Publish a previously created Security Token with identifier `tokenId`.
     *
     * @internal This method MUST use the `PublishToken.execute()` method.
     * @param   {string}          name
     * @param   {Address}         owner
     * @param   {Array<Address>}  operators
     * @return  {PublicProof}
     **/
    public publish(
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier): PublicProof;

    /**
     * Notify an account `account` about 
     * Publish a previously created Security Token with identifier `tokenId`.
     *
     * @internal This method MUST use the `PublishToken` command.
     * @param   {string}          name
     * @param   {Address}         owner
     * @param   {Array<Address>}  operators
     * @return  {PublicProof}
     **/
    public notify(
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier,
      account: Address,
      notification: AccountNotification): NotificationProof;

    /**
     * Verifies **allowance** of `sender` to transfer `tokenId` security token.
     *
     * @param   {Address}         sender
     * @param   {TokenIdentifier} tokenId
     * @return  {AllowanceResult}
     **/
    public canTransfer(
      sender: Address,
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier): AllowanceResult;

    /**
     * Verifies **allowance** of `operator` to execute `command` with `tokenId` security token.
     *
     * @internal This method MUST use the `command.canExecute()` method.
     * @param   {Address}         operator
     * @param   {Address}         account
     * @param   {TokenIdentifier} tokenId
     * @param   {Command}         command
     * @param   {Array<Option>}   argv
     * @return  {AllowanceResult}
     **/
    public canExecute(
      operator: Address,
      account: Address,
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier,
      command: Command,
      argv: [Option] = []): AllowanceResult;

    /**
     * Execute `command` for Security Token with identifier `tokenId`. Arguments
     * the command execution can be passed in `argv`.
     *
     * @internal This method MUST use the `command.execute()` method.
     * @param   {Address}         operator
     * @param   {Address}         account
     * @param   {TokenIdentifier} tokenId
     * @param   {Command}         command
     * @param   {Array<Option>}   argv
     * @return  {CommandResult}
     **/
    public execute(
      operator: Address,
      account: Address,
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier,
      command: Command,
      argv: [Option] = []): CommandResult;

    /**
     * Read metadata of a previously created Security Token with identifier `tokenId`.
     * 
     * @param   {TokenIdentifier}       tokenId
     * @return  {Array<TokenMetadata>}
     **/
    public getMetadata(
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier): [TokenMetadata];

    /**
     * Read restrictions of a previously created Security Token with identifier `tokenId`.
     * 
     * @param   {TokenIdentifier}       tokenId
     * @return  {Array<TokenRestriction|AccountRestriction>}
     **/
    public getRestrictions(
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier,
      account: Address = null): [TokenRestriction|AccountRestriction];
```

Classes implementing the `Standard` interface MUST make use of the `symbol-sdk` package to leverage Catapult features.

- A `Command` interface is defined that MUST contain following methods:

```javascript
    /**
     * Verifies **allowance** of `operator` to execute command with `tokenId` security token
     * for `account`. Parameters `account` and `operators` will be the same when the account
     * is supposed to execute the command directly.
     *
     * @param   {Address}         operator
     * @param   {Address}         account
     * @param   {TokenIdentifier} tokenId
     * @param   {Array<Option>}   argv
     * @return  {AllowanceResult}
     **/
    public canExecute(
      operator: Address,
      account: Address,
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier,
      argv: [Option] = []): AllowanceResult;

    /**
     * Execute `command` for Security Token with identifier `tokenId`. Arguments
     * the command execution can be passed in `argv`. Parameters `account` and `operators` 
     * will be the same when the account is supposed to execute the command directly.
     *
     * @param   {Address}         operator
     * @param   {Address}         account
     * @param   {TokenIdentifier} tokenId
     * @param   {Array<Option>}   argv
     * @return  {CommandResult}
     **/
    public execute(
      operator: Address,
      account: Address,
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier,
      argv: [Option] = []): CommandResult;
```

Classes implementing the `Command` interface MUST make use of the `symbol-sdk` package to leverage Catapult features.
