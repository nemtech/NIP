## Introduction

This document aims to provide with a **standard** for _issuance_ and _management_ of **security tokens** on Symbol. This standard will be structured as such that _standard interfaces_ will be defined to facilitate _operations_ and _interrogations_ related to security tokens.

## Motivation 

Facilitate and accelerate the processes of _issuance_ and _management_ of security tokens on Symbol.

To issue and manage securities on Symbol, this standard will leverage several Symbol features. Implementation details will be described in a document jointly to this standard definition.

## Requirements

The security token standards to be described in this document will be based on features available with [Symbol][symbol] networks. Additionally, for each standard, we will define requirements that will apply to the underlying asset class.

- MUST have a standard interface to query feasibility of a transfer and return a reason for failures.
- MUST be able to perform forced transfer for legal action or fund recovery.
- MUST define standard notifications for issuance and redemption processes.
- MUST be able to attach metadata to a **subset of a token holder's balance**.
- MUST be able to modify metadata at time of transfer based on off-chain data, on-chain data and the parameters of the transfer.
- MUST support querying and subscribing to updates on any relevant documentation for the security.
- MAY require signed data to be passed into a transfer transaction in order to validate it on-chain.
- SHOULD NOT restrict the range of asset classes across jurisdictions which can be represented.

### Features Description

Following features table will be used to define mandatory features of the published software package:

| Feature | Motivation |
| --- | --- |
| Issuance | Issuance of security tokens is managed through `owner` |
| Issuer Power Delegation | `Operators` can be allowed specific management tasks of the security tokens |
| Transfer |  Security tokens can be transferred (change ownership) |
| Batch Transfer | Security tokens can be transferred in batches (change ownership) |
| Transfer with Metadata | Metadata can be added to transfers of security tokens |
| Metadata management | Metadata can be managed for security tokens |
| Transfer restrictions | Transfers of security tokens can be restricted (constraints) |
| Freeze/Lock | Security token balances can be frozen/locked by `operators` |
| Operator enforcement | `Operators` can be allowed tasks enforcements (such as transfers) |
| Force Transfer | Transfers of security tokens can be **enforced**. |
| Error signaling | Error signaling is described for each Standard |
| Document management | Documents can be attached to security tokens [ownerships] |

### NEM Security Token Commands

NEM Security Token Standards introduce the term of **commands** that are executed for specific tokens. For instance, the transfer of token happens by _executing the command TransferOwnership_ for said token.

This concept of _commands_ will be available for all NEM Security Token Standards. As such we will define a list of commands that will also be technically defined in the implementation details.

| Token Command | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| **PublishToken** | Issue/Publish a previously created token (non-reversable) |
| **TransferOwnership** | Transfer a token to a new owner |
| **TransferOwnershipWithData** | Transfer a token to a new owner, adding signed data as a message |
| **BatchTransferOwnership** | Batch Transfer tokens to new owners |
| **ForcedTransfer** | Force the transfer of a token to a new owner, with an operator account |
| **LockBalance** | Freeze / Lock a token balance |
| **UnlockBalance** | Unfreeze / Unlock a token balance |
| **ModifyRestriction** | Send modifications to account/mosaic restrictions |
| **ModifyMetadata** | Send modifications to account/mosaic metadata |
| **DelegateIssuerPower** | Delegate issuance authorizations to operator(s) account(s) |
| **AttachDocument** | Attach documents to a token instance |

### NEM Security Token Restrictions

:warning: Specific token and account restrictions must be describe here.

### NEM Security Token Metadata

:warning: Standard usage of metadata for token, account and namespaces must be described here.

### Namespaced Standards

Because each of NEM Security Token Standards will behave differently from others with regards to feature set integrations, we will implement commands in such a way that each standard can define its own extension to the standard command execution flow.

Commands will be grouped in **namespaces** such that each NEM Security Token Standard can implement commands with its own feature set integration practises. Following examples MAY apply:

#### Use the NIP13 standard and execute PublishToken command

```typescript
// Import NIP13 namespace
import { NIP13 } from 'symbol-security-tokens';

// prepare
const tokenId = new TokenIdentifier();
const command = new NIP13.PublishToken();
const options = [Option.create('tokenId', tokenId.toString())];

// now execute command
const result = command.execute(tokenId, options);
```

### NIP-13

NIP#13 introduces a NEM Security Token Standard which will be implemented mostly with **mosaics**, **multi-signature** accounts and transactions. Work on this standard has not begun by the time of writing.

#### Integration Notes

| Command | Execution Flow |
| --- | --- |
| **PublishToken** | 1) Creates a deterministic operator account <br> 2) Convert operator account to multi-signature <br> 3) Publish creation proof transaction on deterministic account <br> 4) Create **mosaic** with operator account |
| **TransferOwnership** | 1) Change ownership of token through **multi-signature modification** using transaction as execution proof |
| **TransferOwnershipWithData** | 1) Prepare signed data (3rd-party client side) <br> 2) Change ownership of token through **multi-signature modification** using transaction as execution proof and **attach signed data** inside transfer transaction from the operator accountt |
| **ForcedTransfer** | 1) TBD - should use mosaic restrictions |
| **BatchTransferOwnership** | 1) Change ownership of tokens with multiple execution proof transactions |
| **DelegateIssuerPower** | 1) Modify multi-signature account to add/remove operators |
| **AttachDocument** | 1) Publish cryptographic hash of document <br> 2) Send message in transaction to deterministic account |

### NEM Standards

Following features are available with our Security Token Standard:

| Issuance | :white_check_mark: |
| Issuer Power Delegation | :white_check_mark: |
| Transfer | :white_check_mark: |

## NEM Security Token Library

This document defines a general purpose NEM Security Token Standards (**NST**). Those defined standards will leverage different feature sets of Symbol networks. More detailed implementation details should be described in the implementation details document.

### Specification

In order to generalize and facilitate security token issuance and management with Symbol, we will publish **one software package** that integrates _all NEM Security Token Standards_.

Still, each of our different standards will be implementing features differently as to be more flexible and allow a broader scope of integrations or use case implementations.

The released software package will be developed with Typescript, using the [symbol-sdk@>=0.17.3][src-sdk] package to integrate latest Symbol features. The library MUST provide with interfaces and classes, which developers can leverage to manage issuance and redemptions of security tokens on Symbol.

As a proof of concept for this library, we MAY introduce either of a command line interface (CLI) or a basic web application to provide with out-of-the-box Security Token support for Symbol.

#### Packaging

A deliverable package will be produced along with this NIP. Naming for this package is **yet to be defined**. 

Following are the available package name suggestions, more may be added at a later point:

- [ ] `symbol-security-tokens`
- [ ] `symbol-financial-instruments`
- [ ] `symbol-financial-tools`
- [ ] `symbol-derivatives`
- [ ] `symbol-instruments`

The decision making process for this package name selection will be made internally, more suggestions are welcome.

#### Architecture Proposal

Each of our Security Token Standards will implement features with a pre-defined feature set of Symbol. This is important to note as this knowledge will influence the architecture of the release package. Following solution proposal can be applied:

- A `Standard` interface is defined that MUST contain following methods:

```javascript
    /**

     *
     * @param   {string}          name
     * @param   {Address}         owner

     **/
    public create(
      name: string,

     **/
    public notify(
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier,
      account: Address,
      notification: AccountNotification): NotificationProof;

    /**
     * Verifies **allowance** of `sender` to transfer `tokenId` security token.
     *
     * @param   {Address}         sender
     * @param   {TokenIdentifier} tokenId
     * @return  {AllowanceResult}
     **/
    public canTransfer(
      sender: Address,
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier): AllowanceResult;

    /**

     * @param   {Array<Option>}   argv
     * @return  {AllowanceResult}
     **/
    public canExecute(
      operator: Address,
      account: Address,
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier,
      command: Command,
      argv: [Option] = []): AllowanceResult;

    /**
     * Execute `command` for Security Token with identifier `tokenId`. Arguments
     * the command execution can be passed in `argv`.
     *

    public execute(
      operator: Address,
      account: Address,
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier,
      command: Command,
      argv: [Option] = []): CommandResult;

     * @return  {Array<TokenMetadata>}
     **/
    public getMetadata(
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier): [TokenMetadata];

    /**

     **/
    public getRestrictions(
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier,

```

:warning: **Definition of new NEM Security Token Standards must follow the [`CONTRIBUTING.MD`][Annex 1: Contribution Guidelines] contribution guidelines and [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`][Annex 2: Code of Conduct].**

Classes implementing the `Standard` interface MUST make use of the `symbol-sdk` package to leverage Catapult features.

- A `Command` interface is defined that MUST contain following methods:

```javascript
    /**
     * Verifies **allowance** of `operator` to execute command with `tokenId` security token
     * for `account`. Parameters `account` and `operators` will be the same when the account
     * is supposed to execute the command directly.
     *
     * @param   {Address}         operator
     * @param   {Address}         account
     * @param   {TokenIdentifier} tokenId
     * @param   {Array<Option>}   argv
     * @return  {AllowanceResult}
     **/
    public canExecute(
      operator: Address,
      account: Address,
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier,
      argv: [Option] = []): AllowanceResult;

    /**
     * Execute `command` for Security Token with identifier `tokenId`. Arguments
     * the command execution can be passed in `argv`. Parameters `account` and `operators` 
     * will be the same when the account is supposed to execute the command directly.
     *
     * @param   {Address}         operator
     * @param   {Address}         account
     * @param   {TokenIdentifier} tokenId
     * @param   {Array<Option>}   argv
     * @return  {CommandResult}
     **/
    public execute(
      operator: Address,
      account: Address,
      tokenId: TokenIdentifier,
      argv: [Option] = []): CommandResult;
```

:warning: **Definition of new NEM Security Token Commands must follow the [`CONTRIBUTING.MD`][Annex 1: Contribution Guidelines] contribution guidelines and [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`][Annex 2: Code of Conduct].**

Classes implementing the `Command` interface MUST make use of the `symbol-sdk` package to leverage Catapult features.
