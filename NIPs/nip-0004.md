## Introduction

This NIP defines a URI scheme to serve transactions ready to be signed.

## Specification

**URI scheme**

``web+nem://transaction?format=<format>?data=<data>?chainId=<chainId>?endpoint=<endpoint>``

|**Parameter**      | **Description** | **Example**|
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| format | "JSON", "serialized" | serialized |
| data   | The transaction [formatted as JSON](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-sdk-java/blob/450676210c5a75f4624fc3bee7bbde96740109d1/src/main/java/io/nem/sdk/infrastructure/TransactionMapping.java) or [serialized hexadecimal form](https://nemtech.github.io/api.html#serialization).| A700...4000000 |
| chainId | The chain identifier. Popular networks identifiers will be defined in this NIP. | nem-public-chain|
| endpoint | (optional) The prefered server to announce the transaction. The application could have another strategy to select the endpoint, ommiting this field. | http://localhost:3000 |

## Motivation

An application built-on NEM may request an account to sign a prepared transaction. Taking as an example the following user story:

``` 
As a customer,
I want to pay for a ticket using my wallet,
so that there is no need to trust the ticket vendor website.
```

The customer has selected a ticket on the ticket vendor website and it is ready to pay. 
The experience suggests that apps built on NIS1 would use one of the following solutions:

**A) The ticket vendor offers a client-side app**

A user downloads the ticket vendor open-source app in local to sign a transaction.
Then, the user can inspect the code, checking the transaction defined does what is expected.

From the UX point of view, having to inspect the code to see what the app is not ideal.

**B) The customer sends a transaction to a determined address**

The user has to define the transaction manually in the NEMWallet. The address or the message set could be wrong, and the user spends an unnecessary time.

**C) The customer scans a QR code**
 
A mobile phone scans a QR code served by an application. QR codes are useful when a person uses mobile as a secure device, but it is operating with a computer. 

This approach is not complete, since:

* It only works when using two devices, and one of them is a mobile phone.
* NEM has different types of transactions, and the [current QR standard](https://github.com/NemProject/nem-library-ts/blob/master/src/services/QRService.ts#L56) only handled one of them.

The aforementioned downsides encourage looking forward to other alternatives. [This article](https://logbooksocial.github.io/blog/development/2018/11/16/ux-i.html) discusses how the interaction between NEM apps and users should be when signing transactions. One of the proposed approaches is to define a standard URI scheme.

## Design Decisions

Applications using NEM must be able to prepare transactions, so that final users can decide to sign them from a secure application. Inspired in Ethereum’s [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), the next NEM wallet could be served online, but signing and announcing transactions is done from the client side.

A URI scheme enables the communication between applications and the future NEM wallet. It can be recognized by desktop and [mobile wallets](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app), opening the app with the transaction ready to be signed. 

The protocol adds ``web+`` add the beginning of the scheme due to a [security requirement for Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerProtocolHandler).

Creating a separated URI scheme library to extend the SDK is possible but expensive, because of all the possible permutations coming from:

* Each programming language requires the development of a library.
* Each implementation of the library needs to be updated when adding new transaction types.

A convenient solution partially exists, by using the internal SDK classes already implemented that serialize and deserialize transactions from JSON and serialized. 

Attaching transactions as serialized data or JSON we achieve the following properties:

* The scheme definition will not change if there is the need to add new types of transactions. 
* The developer can choose the format, deciding if it's more important that the URL is human readable or compact. 
* Multiple transactions can be announced serializing aggregate transactions (serialized format preferred).

## Implementation

* Changes required in the SDK: [Expose serialization methods](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-sdk-typescript-javascript/issues/56)

* Experimental implementation: [nem2-uri-scheme](https://github.com/dgarcia360/nem2-uri-scheme)

*  Wallet integration: [cw-extension](https://github.com/aleixmorgadas/cw-extesnion)

## Backwards compatibility

NIS1 does not have a known standard URI scheme.
